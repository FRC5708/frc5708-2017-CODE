## How to import project into eclipse

If you don't see the option listed, you should probably click "next".

File->Import->Git->Projects from Git->Clone URI->paste the clone URL->select branch->Put where you want to keep the project->Import using the New Project wizard->click finish->WPILib Robot C++ Development->Robot C++ Project->Command based Robot->Finish. Ignore any errors about "Git team provider." Click cancel if the wizard is still open. You should see the project in the project explorer (Window->Show View->Project Explorer).
